Face recognition
================
Face_recognition is a face detection and recognition library
which allows you to detect
and recognize faces without using OpenCV.

Built using Dlib models.

It's provided a simple face detection and face recognition command line tool that lets you detect and recognize images from a folder using the command line.

It't the firs version of the library.

    unknown_image = face_recognition.load_image_file("unknown_image.jpg")

    image_encoding = face_recognition.face_encodings(image)[0]
    unknown_encoding = face_recognition.face_encodings("unknown_image")[0]

    result = face_recognition.compare_faces([image_encoding], unknown_encoding)

Real time face detection
